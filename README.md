# LibraryManagerApp
A project for my Pirple Javascript OOP Homework


A Library Manager Application seems to be a project that I would do using OOP, since there are quite a lot of objects to be constructed and I will need to use inheritance.

Let's say this is for a made up library in a made up town. Membership requires a valid address in the said town, as the library has printed books not ebooks. Members can create an account, search the online book-catalogue, rate the books they read and write reviews, make and get recommendations.
